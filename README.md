# Rhythm Searcher Front End

Hello. This repository is the front end code for my "Rhythm Searcher" web application. Here, you can find my TypeScript code I used to create the front end of my rhythm searcher.

## What this code should do:

Provide the form for Users to search rhythms; Send an HTTP Request for an array of "rhythm" objects; Display array, and allow user to pick 1 rhythm out of the array (which is displayed as an array of numbers like "[3,3,3,3,3,1]"). Allow users to playback the selected array.

In the future, I wish to be able to display the rhythms as engraved musical notation, and to be able to let the user search for rhythms in more odd subdivisions and time signatures

The storage and return of those rhythm objects will be handled by the backend/Django portion of the code.
