# Rhythm Searcher Front End

Hello. This repository is the front end code for my "Rhythm Searcher" web application. Here, you can find my TypeScript code I used to create the front end of my rhythm searcher.

## What this code should do:

Provide the form for Users to search rhythms; Send an HTTP Request for an array of "rhythm" objects; Use array and turn it into musical notation (and hopefully playback in the future);

The storage and return of those rhythm objects will be handled by the backend/Django portion of the code.
